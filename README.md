# Nordic

The Nordic project is an attempt to create the Nord Theme for Visual Studio 2019. 

It is still in an initial state (incorrect color pairings between foreground and background, etc).

The colors used for this theme can be found here https://www.nordtheme.com/.
But The use of colours is not based on the definitions, but rather corresponds to personal taste.

Some of the Visual Studio windows cannot be color adjusted. Therefore, these windows do not look like they belong together.

When the project has reached a level that is personally acceptable, I will try to submit the project as Visual Studio 2019 port to the Nord Community.


## Installation

Just install the current vsix, or install the Visual Studio Color Theme Designer Extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner), open the project and build a own vsix to install. 

You can also use the "apply" button of the Designer. However when using this funtion with my version of the extension, I observe a strange behavior.
