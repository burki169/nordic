# Nordic

![alt text](./nordic.png)


The Nordic project is an attempt to create the Nord Theme for Visual Studio 2019. 

It is still in an early state (incorrect color pairings between foreground and background, etc).

The colors used for this theme can be found here https://www.nordtheme.com/.
But The use of colours is not based on the definitions, but rather corresponds to personal taste.

Some of the Visual Studio windows cannot be color adjusted. Therefore, these windows do not look like they belong together.
